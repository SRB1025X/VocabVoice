## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

The Voice Dictionary allows users to search for the meanings of words using voice commands. The application captures voice input through a microphone, recognizes the spoken words using Google's speech recognition, and then fetches the meanings of the recognized word using the PyDictionary library. The application provides a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter, displaying the voice search option, a label indicating the current status (listening or recognizing), and a label that shows the meaning of the searched word. The user triggers the search by clicking the "Search" button.
